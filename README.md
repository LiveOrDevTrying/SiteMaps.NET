# **[SiteMaps.NET](https://www.github.com/liveordevtrying/sitemaps.net)**
[SiteMaps.NET](https://www.github.com/liveordevtrying/sitemaps.net) is a middleware designed to support Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for Asp.NET Core 2.0 + and will dynamically create a Sitemap.xml and / or Robots.txt for your web application. The Sitemap.xml will be created dynamically by default by parsing the controllers in the parent project and creating routes in the Xml for each method. However, this can be overriden so you can instead specify the mapped endpoints directly. You can also use the included attributes to annotate your project to specify which methods you would like to be included. You can also include specific endpoints for individual page SEO indexing - for example, a product list where each product has its own page and unique uri. If enabled, this package will also create a Robots.txt and allow you to create custom robot rules to disallow routes / user agents.
